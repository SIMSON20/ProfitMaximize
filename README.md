# Optimize Total Income of Taxi Driver

Using the **NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC)** Yellow Taxi dataset from June 2017, we will try to solve following questions?

1. Imagine that you decide to drive a taxi for 10 hours each week to earn a little extra money. Explain how you would approach maximizing your income as a taxi driver.

2. If you could enrich the dataset, what would you add?  Is there anything in the dataset that you donâ€™t find especially useful?


#### Instructions
